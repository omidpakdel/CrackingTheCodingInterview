# Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to programming interview questions from the book [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. I've implemented these solutions in C#, and they serve as a reference for tackling common technical interview challenges.
