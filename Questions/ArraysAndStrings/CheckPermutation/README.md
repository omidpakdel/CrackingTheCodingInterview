# Check Permutation

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

A Permutation of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are Permutation of each other. Strings with different length can not be considered, its wrong.
